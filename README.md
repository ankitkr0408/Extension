Tech Stack :- HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT,API's
I Made this using Manifest.json file to estb my extension in chrome extension columns.Then I started working on its backend with the html and Js.Then following the API, I made it's working. And for styling I used CSS and logo to get the different chrome extension.
While making this I learned how to make extension and how to publish it.
